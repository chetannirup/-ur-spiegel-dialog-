    <h2>The Core Issue: The 'Implementation Problem'</h2>
    <p>This is precisely the point where <strong>Prof. Radermacher</strong> hits the nail on the head: he often refers to this as the <strong>‘implementation problem’</strong>. We have the best scientific analyses, the concepts for global fairness are sitting in drawers, but as he says: there are no binding rules.</p>
    <p>In his speeches, he often emphasises three bitter realities as to why it does not seem ‘feasible’ so far:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The dilemma of voluntarism:</strong> as long as agreements are only suggestions, every state (especially the major powers) will always put its own ‘national egoism’ first. This is exactly the pattern we know from the history of 1914 or 1939 – only today it takes the form of economics.</li>
        <li><strong>The power of corporations:</strong> He often points out that global corporations are more powerful today than many nation states. They can evade rules as long as there is no global regulatory system (such as an eco-social world constitution).</li>
        <li><strong>The ‘explosive power’ of inequality:</strong> Radermacher warns that current inequality is tearing the world apart. If we do not go ‘all in’ (as in his Marshall Plan proposal), the ‘human tide’ of poverty migration or resource wars will eventually bring the systems crashing down anyway.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Approach: 'Spiritual Socialism'</h2>
    <p>Your idea could close the gap left by purely technical pragmatism. Why is nothing binding today? Because there is no longer a common ‘why’ – no spiritual or deeper ethical connection between people across borders.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>From contract to alliance:</strong> A purely legal contract is cold and will be broken if it is profitable to do so. ‘Spiritual socialism’ would mean that the bond between people (the ‘double eagle’ idea of unity in diversity) becomes so deeply ingrained in consciousness that exploitation is perceived as an attack on oneself.</li>
        <li><strong>Pragmatism with soul:</strong> Radermacher provides the architecture (taxes on resources, minimum social standards), but this concept provides the ‘mortar’ – the feeling and conviction that it is right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion for 2026: Knowledge Without Action</h2>
    <p>We are now at the point you described: we know everything, but we do nothing. We have tanks without fuel (technology without purpose) and information without wisdom.</p>
    <p>Today, ‘feasibility’ no longer depends on technology – we could feed and heal the planet tomorrow. It depends on the decision whether we continue to remain in ‘ego socialism’ or ‘predatory capitalism’ or whether we have the courage to create a binding world order that finally puts people and their feelings at the centre.</p>
    <p>It is like the Battle of Leuven in 891 or Dunkirk in 1940: in the end, it is not the numbers on paper that decide, but whether one is ‘awake’ at the decisive moment or (like the boss in Normandy) sleeps through the invasion of reality.</p>
